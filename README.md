# Predicting_And_Evaluating_The_Popularity_of_Online_News
Given the rising popularity of the internet as a news source, it is imperative for companies to understand what makes an online news article popular. This paper examines this very predicament by working to describe the characteristics of popular online news articles using various popular machine learning classification techniques. Using a large data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we predict the popularity of online news articles using four algorithms: (I) Logistic Regression, (II) Naïve Bayes, (III) Support Vector Machines and (IV) Random Forest. Before implementation, we analyzed the variance and dependency of various features on our target outcome to only include strongly explanatory features and improve accuracy. We found our feature selection techniques were minimally hepful in improving accuracy scores, largely because the data provided is extremely clean and well-prepared. This project was completed as part of an undergraduate course, CSC 240 – Data Mining taken at the University of Rochester during Spring 2019.
